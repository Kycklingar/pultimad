		<p><div class="post-body"><p>So, it&#39;s sorta 2018&#39;s JAM going on, and I got kinda these two ideas that could be worked either into really short comics or image series or a mix of both.</p><p>Idea 1: Setting in the Skyrim, where Jenny tries another magic spell to keep warm, and ends up somehow botching it up, turning Renamon and Krystal into her clones physically (just with different hair colors). Various hijinks ensues as various groups in Skyrim suddenly find the &#39;triplets&#39; quite attractive.</p><p>Sub-options: Possibility of being rescued later by StarFox team? Also getting &#39;wrecked&#39; by the whole team. Slippy breaking in all three ladies the best way he knows?</p><p>Idea 2: Jenny meets S&#39;Rena in the bar soon after events of SAD comic, and comments on her &#39;attire&#39;. S&#39;Rena ends up showing Jenny various drawings of her, while Jenny reads up S&#39;Rena&#39;s more lewdier thoughts, which makes them both end up at Jenny&#39;s bedroom, where she makes good use of the kinky digimon&#39;s mouth and some various toys of hers.</p><p>Sub-options: Slippy walks in, wrecks them both good? Jenny ending up wearing something similar chastity belt + some sort of locked-on slave girl gear?</p></div></p>

		<p><div class="post-body"><p>A little update on some stuff.</p><p><strong>Goals</strong> - Changed them around a little to fit more into what I&#39;ve got planned in the near future, and I&#39;m still in the process of trying to think what more to add in them, unless something in my real life situation changes again.</p><p><strong>Image quality</strong> - Also I got notified about image compression that happens when images are uploaded on Patreon. It does seem to affect JPG image quality somewhat, but almost none to PNG&#39;s as far as I can tell so far, and the packed up images in zip files were unaffected completely... So, I&#39;ll probably be shifting to uploading even the low-res images more as lossless PNG quality from now on. (except maybe sketches)</p><p>I wont be updating past posts though, but you can find the images at my archive site ( <a href="http://sunset.finalsunrise.net/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://sunset.finalsunrise.net/</a> ), uncompressed, if you wish to download them (or any of my galleries, as well). There should images up to end of 2016 so far, and I&#39;ll be updating 2017 ones there as well later on, but I can make easy to download image packs easily if you wish.</p><p><strong>Reward tiers</strong> - Still working on this, but there might be coming new $5.00 tier sometime soon, once I figure things out a bit more and what all to add to it.</p><p><br/></p><p>Also if you have anything else you&#39;d like to talk about, suggestions and whatnot, just let me know, you can comment on here, send a PM or chat about it in Discord channel.</p></div></p>

A monthly pinup character vote maybe? Wallpapers and other specials?<br/></p><p>$1000 - Would pay off both rent and bills. That&#39;d leave me lots more free time so far, so would also do maybe a request stream or few during the month.</p><p>$2500 - This would ensure I could focus full-time on art and comics, and even save up some for other stuff. Not sure yet what I could offer here though. Ideas?</p><p>As for pledges, they would look like this...</p><p>-$1 would give access to sketches, WIPs and various new ideas I&#39;d be posting about. As well finished artwork and comics. Same as before.<br/></p><p>-Next tier would be dropped from $15 to $2.50, and would give access to all high-res artwork and comics as usual. Maybe some special packs as well.</p><p>-Not sure if I should yet add more tiers, but if do, they&#39;d probably be limited slot ones or somesuch.</p><br/><p>So, ideas, suggestions and such are welcome.<br/></p></div></p>

Happy Halloween! Remember to press space to coom.<br/>â <strong>Double up</strong> - The color poll tied this month, so I colored both the winners. Enjoy!<br/>â <strong>Hot water</strong> - you&#39;ve probably heard about Patreon looking hard at externally-hosted content this past month for anything that could be perceived as minor content. We got looked at too - and some of the stuff in the gallery had to be censored out. It was pretty painless, but I did have to cobble together some quick changes to facilitate it. Evidently any content which is directly linked to by the campaign will need to stay like this.</p><p>As such, to keep us out of hot water moving forward, the &#34;official&#34; gallery for the campaign is now <a href="https://notboogie.com/PatreonGallery" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">/PatreonGallery</a>. This gallery conforms to Patreon&#39;s standards, and will be the only thing directly linked to on the campaign. Feel free to visit a non-patreon section of the site for non-patreon content, though. I cleared this with the staff so you guys should be good with a little looking around.</p><p>Additionally, to further help keep us in the green, and because a group&#39;s judgement is more important than just mine, I&#39;ve added a flagging mode to the gallery; you can activated it via the &#34;enable flagging&#34; button on the gallery&#39;s left filter menu. If you see something which you think would be frowned upon by Patreon, simply enable the mode and click the resulting red flag on the item. This will tell me to check it, and I can consider removing it from the campaign listing.</p><p><strong>SITE NEWS</strong></p><p>â Apparently November is Patreon appreciation month - so I have some QoL fixes set up for you!</p><ul> <li><strong>Updated database tables with proper keying</strong> - load times should be a bit quicker across the board!</li> <li><strong>Automatic session renewal</strong> - instead of needing to sign into Patreon every time you visit, the site will now do it for you! I set up a neat system to facilitate this, and Patreon tokens are valid for one month, so you should be able to stay logged in until it needs refreshed. It should also automatically adapt to tier changes just as smoothly.<br/>*There&#39;s currently a bug with this where loading a direct link to an item will still display the &#34;this is for tier X Patreons dialog&#34; before the system renews your session. Working on a fix for this.</li> <li><strong>Rev up them standards</strong> - the new gallery is now part of the same template as the rest of the site, ensuring synchronization.</li> <li><strong>Bug reports</strong> - Added a bug report button to the header, so you needn&#39;t go out of your way to use Patreon&#39;s PM system. Note that this is just for bringing shit to my attention/yelling at me - if you want a conversation you&#39;ll still need to contact elsewhere (until I figure out how to properly implement in-site messages)</li> <li><strong>Thank you</strong>!

But the thing clearly stands no chance against the other content types and I feel the efforts would be better utilized elsewhere. However a &#34;sketch suggestion&#34; section has been added to the Nomination page to compensate, so you lads can still feed me your dirty ideas if you&#39;d like! <em>Also I should probably specify that the Sketch option in the Content poll and the actual poll with the sketches are two different things. The &#34;sketch suggestion&#34; bit will still have a poll to help me gauge what the general consensus wants to see.</em><br/>â Campaign graphics updated!<br/>â New tier added: &#34;Maestro&#34; - Tier 4 - enables access to a new special sketch poll, which I&#39;m thinking will push me to sketch more and improve my speed, and also open up the creation floor to more niche tastes.<br/>â New tier added: &#34;Madman&#34; - Tier 5 - This is basically a placeholder which I&#39;m thinking could eventually turn into an additional sketch poll or maybe a second bonus poll, depending on how the new tier 4 plays out. There&#39;s no major perk yet - though it will give applicants quadruple poll weight.<br/>â I&#39;ve decided to keep the &#34;make your lowest tier $2 because Patreon says to due to charges&#34; thing mentioned in the list of potential changes on the backburner for now. We might come back to it once I&#39;m convinced it won&#39;t screw anyone/thing over, but for now it&#39;s not being implemented.</p><p><strong>SITE NEWS</strong></p><p>â The Commission page is finished, an announcement explaining it will show up when I&#39;ve juiced out the rest of my current rounds and am ready to open it.<br/>â Updated the Nomination page to reflect the new structure.<br/>â Revisions are now tier&#39;d individually in the Gallery, so released items which get poll&#39;d into coloring will stay freely available instead of getting bumped up into Early Access with the latest revision.</p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL</strong> <strong>NEWS</strong></p><p>â P-pls leave me feedback.</p><p>Anyway, we&#39;ll try this new format for a month or two and see how it goes.

		<p><div class="post-body"><p><em>First the obligatory poll announcements:</em></p><h3><a href="https://notboogie.com/Polls" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>The May polls are up!</strong></em></u></a></h3><p><a href="https://notboogie.com/NewNominate" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>You can also start submitting nominations for June.</strong></em></u></a> <a href="https://notboogie.com/PatreonRewards" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>And the May stream recordings are uploaded for those interested!</strong></em></u></a></p><p><strong>PATREON</strong> <strong>NEWS</strong></p><p>â Alright boys, hear me out. I&#39;ve been chewing on this for months, and I think it&#39;s about time to move it from &#34;idea&#34; to &#34;serious consideration&#34;. Basically, it&#39;s a structure update for the campaign. The goal is to help &amp; modernize growth while keeping everyone happy.</p><p><strong>All of these proposed changes are tentative</strong>, all could go forward or none of them could. That&#39;s why I&#39;m consulting you about &#39;em before I make any moves. Please let me know any thoughts you have on any of them, even if it&#39;s just &#34;X bad&#34; or &#34;Y good&#34;. Gauging interest or the lack-thereof will help greatly with these decisions.</p><p><strong>PROPOSED CHANGES</strong></p><ul> <li><strong>Remove the Sketch content poll</strong></li></ul><p>The original idea behind the sketch poll served 2 purposes. It was meant to allow you guys to push content you want to see from beginning to end (IE being chosen as a sketch, and then later being turned into a finished image via the color poll), and it was also to give the lads who like my sketches but not my color to have something to play with. However between animation and color, the thing is clearly outclassed. Therefor, I&#39;m proposing we just drop it, and move the efforts involved to fresher pastures, which you&#39;ll find in another change below.</p><p><em>(Some of you might be wondering why the 3D poll isn&#39;t looking at the same treatment since it&#39;s not much of a challenger to the big 2 either. The answer is simply I think what I&#39;m planning for the genre will raise some eyebrows in the not-too-distant future. You&#39;ll see. Huehuehue.)</em></p><ul> <li><strong>Add $15 tier</strong></li></ul><p>People have suggested adding more higher tiers several times in the past, but there&#39;s a fine line of balance to consider; I don&#39;t want to just chuck up tiers without rewards for your patronage, and I also don&#39;t want to offer too many or too sizable rewards overall because the resulting overload could threaten my already packed schedule and endeavors, and thus hamper work on the larger projects.</p><p>So what I&#39;m proposing is another high tier - $15, where the reward is a private sketch nomination/poll. I figure if you&#39;re supporting me with that much, you must have pretty similar deviant tastes to me, which means the voter base would be generally cohesive and everyone would be able to enjoy the inevitable fetishes this smaller pool would produce at least to some degree without anyone feeling left out.</p><p><em>There&#39;s also the possibility of a $20 tier, with the same idea, but to me right now it&#39;s not a serious consideration. Additionally, there&#39;s the idea to make the results of this poll stay in the elevated tier 3 early access queue with the large project WIPs to give that tier set more meat, but I&#39;m not yet sold on that idea.</em></p><ul> <li><strong>Rework all Patreon tier graphics</strong> to have that sleek 80&#39;s theme like I used in <a href="https://twitter.com/NotBoogie/status/1126236845656944642" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this shitpost</a>.</li></ul><p>Nice aesthetic, eye catching, more interesting than the current little black Melo cutout graphics. Also possibly change the tier names to something more verbose.</p><ul> <li><strong>Change the $1 tier</strong> (super tentative, just putting the idea out there)</li></ul><p>I&#39;m sure by now you&#39;ve heard about the <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/refresh-patreon-tiers" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon creator videocast</a> that revealed a $1 pledge gets gibbed down to $0.40~$0.60 for the creator because Patreon is Patreon, and they suggest everyone move their lowest tier to $2 or a higher number to account for this. The whole thing&#39;s dumb, but I calculated it out, and the &#34;take-home&#34; difference is actually a couple hundred bucks, which is a lot of groceries; so it&#39;s worth considering. Having $2 as the lowest number on the campaign may be beneficial for the long-term health of it as new pledges come in and &#34;supporter/creator culture&#34; grows.</p><p>However that&#39;s not to say we can just shaft the current group of $1 lads. We have the benefit of running this whole show through the gallery, which runs on pledge amount rather than Patreon&#39;s actual registered tier. A $1 pledge could still enable all of the current rewards, or I could simply add a flag to the pre-change supporters on the site which would still give them access for their dollar.</p><ul> <li><strong>Wrapping up</strong></li></ul><p>So basically if everything went through the new structure would look like this:</p><p>Tier 1 ($2, but everyone currently pledged can still access for $1) - Voting and nomination, source file access<br/>Tier 2 ($5) - Early access, +2 poll weight, stream recordings, bonus poll<br/>Tier 3 ($10) - Elevated early access, +3 poll weight<br/>Tier 4 ($15) - Sketch poll<br/>(Possible: Tier 5 ($20) - Another sketch or bonus poll? +4 poll weight?)</p><p>If you have any comments or suggestions, throw &#39;em over. It takes a lot of secondary viewpoints to work out what&#39;s best for everyone!</p><p><strong>SITE NEWS</strong></p><p>â The gallery has been redesigned - if you haven&#39;t seen it yet, you can learn more from <a href="https://twitter.com/NotBoogie/status/1132030523541471233" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the announcement video</a>.<br/>â For you lads who have been chomping at the bit on commissions, the commission system I&#39;ve been working on is nearly ready and will probably show up next month; though when it&#39;ll be open I&#39;m not sure.</p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL</strong> <strong>NEWS</strong> </p><p>â I&#39;m going to be out of town the week of the 5th, so be aware I won&#39;t be around.</p><p>Thanks, everyone! I love you guys (â¡ â¿ â¡ âª ) .</p><p>&lt;3!</p></div></p>

That should be plenty of time for everyone to put their hat in the ring. Your nomination is tied to your account, so you can edit it at any time by resubmitting the page.</p><p>The Character input is a selection box, so if your waifu has already been nominated, just select her option. Otherwise, enter her as a new entry! This consistency with the names will let me easily tally up who&#39;s being demanded the most.</p><p>If you encounter any errors on the new nomination page, please PM me!</p><p><strong>SITE</strong> <strong>UPDATES</strong></p><p>â The new poll and login system has been enabled! For the curious, the new system is basically an internal account system I designed which will better track your votes, preferences, nominations, etc. by tying them to your Patreon ID and an internal user ID. It also runs on Campaign ID, so I could allow other creators to use my poll system if that turns out to be something people want.</p><p>Plus this new system allows your user information to be tracked on a realtime basis and poll numbers to update dynamically, so if your tier weight, name, etc. will all be updated accordingly when you log in. I&#39;ve also implemented an archival system which will automatically archive the results of all polls!</p><p>In the future I may be able to implement a password system too, so you&#39;d still be able to access your specific preferences and whatnot on the odd days when the Patreon API is down, but that&#39;s a nice-to-have for down the line.</p><p>â The new poll page itself is *not* enabled yet - I don&#39;t want to have to shuffle around with any bugs that might still be sleeping in the corners while I&#39;m launching Lana, so our first actual poll using the new page and the new system will be the upcoming Flash vote. Next month&#39;s monthly poll will use the new page!</p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL</strong> <strong>NEWS</strong></p><p>â Don&#39;t tell anyone this because I&#39;m not 100% dedicated to it yet, but I may or may not be slowly carving up an RPG engine for a possible SMRPG/Paper Mario-esque smut game.</p><p>â Reminder that there&#39;s a <a href="https://notboogie.com/nav" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>nav page</strong></a> now for all your site needs!</p><p><strong>ART ITEMS ADDED THIS MONTH</strong></p><ul> <li>+Creme Princess (paper)</li> <li>+Squid mouth (toon)</li> <li>+Midna cumflation (toon) (color vote)</li> <li>+Midna gangbang (sketch)</li> <li>+Judy (sketch) (bonus vote)</li> <li>+Melome squeeze (gray)</li> <li>+MinMin mini vore comic (1,2,3) (sketch)</li> <li>+Sapphire feet (Gray)</li> <li>+Smol 18 (gray)</li> <li>+Phi (sketch)</li> <li>+Katt (sketch)</li> <li>++Lick gif (WIP)</li></ul><p>Thanks for supporting me guys, you&#39;re the best.

It and the new Midna Gif, being &#34;large projects&#34; will be in the box for a month before being released publicly. Please message me any bugs you may find so I can fix them before the public release. Also for you hunters, there&#39;s no Easter egg in the beta, so don&#39;t go crawling around for one just yet.</p><p>â The nominations and vote for the next Patreon goal Flash will go down when Lana goes public - that should give me enough time to finish the updated poll page, which will tie in with your Patreon IDs and be both cleaner and more secure, and will make special polls a lot easier. So get those ideas ready, it&#39;ll be here before you know it.<br/><br/>â The classic password posts now have featured tags! Whenever the Patreon API shits the bed, you can now use the bar on the left of the main page to quickly jump to your tier password.</p><p><strong>SITE</strong> <strong>UPDATES</strong></p><p>â A navigation bar has been added to the updated the Gallery and some other pages! As I make updated versions of the old pages they&#39;ll get it too. If you don&#39;t see it or get some horrendous formatting, press ctrl+f5 to refresh the styling in your cache. Eventually this bar will tie into your Patreon login and let you specific custom preferences, like notification emails whenever I upload something with specific tags or of specific types and whatnot.<br/><br/>â Revisions in the Gallery now apply a new &#34;created by&#34; date, so if I revise something that&#39;s 3 months old into a color version, it&#39;ll pop up to the front of the &#34;Recently Created&#34; filter like I&#39;d just uploaded a new entry.</p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL</strong> <strong>NEWS</strong></p><p>â I&#39;m seeing a couple things in this month&#39;s nomination pool that I&#39;ve already colored. Until I tie nominations to your IDs and can PM you when that happens, here&#39;s a list:<br/>-Insomni mouth (public on Eka&#39;s)<br/>-Inkling mouth (already being colored)<br/>-Classic Aria (was colored this month - in early access)<br/>-21 Butt (was colored this month - in early access)<br/><br/>â The other thing I&#39;m seeing a lot of are gifs being nominated for color. I&#39;m honestly not sure I can consistently handle something like that along with coloring other stuff at the same time. However, I don&#39;t want to leave you guys out in the cold on those if that&#39;s what you lads want to see. If you have any suggestions on how we could handle those without completely overflowing my cup, I&#39;m all ears. Right now I&#39;m considering making them special goal rewards (like the flashes) or maybe another poll category.<br/><br/>â Reminder that there&#39;s a <a href="https://notboogie.com/nav" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>nav page</strong></a> now for all your site needs!</p><p><strong>ART ITEMS ADDED THIS MONTH </strong>(would a list like this be beneficial?)</p><ul> <li>+Lana Flash (1500 poll vote)</li> <li>+Midna footjob .gif (belated bonus vote)</li> <li>+21 butt (color vote)</li> <li>+Aria classic (color vote)</li> <li>+Piro abs (color vote)</li> <li>+Futa Club President (gray bonus vote)</li> <li>+Judy Hopps (sketch vote)</li> <li>+Crest Princess (sketch, color)</li> <li>+Aria cum bulge (sketch)</li> <li>+Aria easter egg (sketch, gray)</li> <li>+Squid mouth (sketch)</li> <li>+Gardevoir milf gangbang (gray)</li></ul><p>Thanks for supporting me guys, you&#39;re the best.</p><p>&lt;3</p></div></p>

Also reminder that the <a href="https://notboogie.com/PatreonVote" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">monthly vote</a> is still happening, so hit that up if you haven&#39;t yet.</p><p>4. I&#39;m most likely going to turn pay-upfront on tomorrow so that it won&#39;t like, double charge anyone during the month turn over. I was leaving it off so that if anyone went in and didn&#39;t like what they found they would be able to pull out before paying, but now that the gallery exists it&#39;s easy to see what you&#39;re in for. All leaving it off now does is invite abuse, which I don&#39;t horribly mind, but it&#39;s unfair to the actual supporters.</p><p>5. I&#39;m more or less going to turtle up with Flash and AE this month, so be prepared for a bit of a dry spell in the color/gray department.</p><p>6. I&#39;ve been debating the best way to notify interested parties of when I post new early access or regular stuff to the site. I&#39;ve been thinking of scripting up a Discord bot to ping a room on a Discord server whenever that happens, thoughts?</p><p>If you have any comments or suggestions for any of this feel free to slide them over.</p><p>&lt;3</p></div></p>

		<p><div class="post-body"><p>Alright boys here goes nothing. <em>I&#39;ve been rolling in the SQL dirt for like 4 hours so forgive me if there&#39;s something misplaced here lol.</em></p><p><strong>TL;DR: Gallery page is in alpha, source file rewards have been merged into it.</strong></p><p>OLD REWARD PAGE: <a href="http://notboogie.com/Patreonrewards" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://notboogie.com/Patreonrewards</a><br/>NEW GALLERY: <a href="http://notboogie.com/gallery" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://notboogie.com/gallery</a></p><p>TL:</p><p>Put simply, I want to move away from Dropbox and Mega. I&#39;d rather have everything hooked up to one central network that doesn&#39;t require a million links to navigate and unmarked folders for you guys to sift through. Not everything is in yet (all dem greys) and there&#39;s much work to do (bugfixes, efficiency tests, tag sorting, I can see some CSS that&#39;s gonna need spruced up, etc), but this is the first step. Consider this the early access alpha test, and if turns out to be a catastrophe we can just go back to the old method.</p><p>However with this comes a few changes to the reward system. Basically since source files are tied into the gallery&#39;s early access functionality, they&#39;ll be available over time as they&#39;re posted publicly instead of in bulk at the end of each month. (Stream recordings will still be in the rewards archive until I can find a better way to display them)</p><p>Put bluntly there&#39;s 2 reasons for this:<br/>1. It&#39;ll be better organized than this hellscape maze of Mega links, they&#39;ll be searchable, and they won&#39;t be obfuscated by my dumb filenames.<br/>2. I&#39;m moving further and further into big endeavors (web space, storage, render farms, utility plugins, more applications, etc) and the cold reality is, well, that shet&#39;s expensive. Cheesing the primary allure of the upper tiers isn&#39;t really (((business savvy))), and I think this is a fair balance between being lucrative and not being a total doucher.</p><p>Shit that&#39;ll be coming in the next few weeks:</p><p>TODO:<br/>-Hook up flashes to display in-page<br/>-Hook up the smart filter (so the first page isn&#39;t all Patreon icons, especially when the rest of the early access box gets uploaded)<br/>-Find a better filter method (the amount of shit uploaded killed performance on the old method)<br/>-Figure out how to generate thumbnails so page loads are quicker<br/>-Make a new background set<br/>-Clean/organize all items with their proper tags (2500 images, kill me)<br/>-Implement set functionality for comics and sequence pics<br/>-Implement a source-file filter for people who just want to study my work<br/>-Add select/deselect all<br/><br/>GALLERY USE:<br/>&gt;Patreon login is on the left. Functions just like any other page<br/>&gt;Results per Page is how many results are included each time you load a set. Defaults to 60.<br/>&gt;Page # is self explanitory<br/>&gt;Clicking a block displays that picture in a modal. Clicking the picture on the modal opens it in a new tab.<br/>&gt;The filter functionality runs on &#34;or&#34; logic (until I have time to re-implement the Hard option). So if you check &#34;Meloetta&#34; and &#34;Midna&#34; you&#39;ll get a list of everything with those two tags associated to it.</p><p><strong>*IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR FIND ANY BUGS, HIT ME WITH A PM PLS*</strong></p><p>&lt;3</p></div></p>
